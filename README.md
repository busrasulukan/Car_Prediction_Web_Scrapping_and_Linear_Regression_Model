# Car Prediction with WebScrapping and Linear Regression Model
This repository, which we created for our second project assignment within the scope of ISDSA- Data Science Bootcamp.
At Istanbul Data Science Academy, we are here with our second project assignment given to us to test our learning level and what we learned about web-scrapping in our Data Science Bootcamp. 
## Introduction
The economic situation has been a determining factor in the purchase of used cars as well. During economic crises or downturns, used cars often become more attractive because they can offer better value for more affordable prices.
Today, used cars are readily available for sale both through online listings and in second-hand car markets.
As a result, our motivation is to create a car value estimation model based on online car prices.
## Purpose
The primary goal is to create a machine learning model to predict the value of vehicles. This carries the objective of providing a transparent and objective valuation process in vehicle sales.
The system being feature-based implies the ability to predict the value by taking into account the unique features of each vehicle.Overcoming the challenge of understanding the data visually by modeling it.
## How?
You can have some advantages when selling through the second-hand site 'arabam.com', some of whichare: Reaching a Wide Audience, Price Comparisons,Fast Sales Opportunity,Various
Filtering Options,Expansion of the Second Hand Market.
In this way, you can quickly obtain the market value of the vehicle you have or the vehicle you want to buy. Second-hand sales platforms offer you the opportunity to obtain information on this subject in the fastest way.
